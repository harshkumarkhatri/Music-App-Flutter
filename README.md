# music_player_app

A music player app made by me in flutter<br>
**About the App**<br>
This is a music player which i made to play audio files which we have passed in the asset folder of this project or audio files which we have specified a path for.<br>
As the app is opened a splash screen is shown for the first 3-5 seconds depending upon your loading time. After this next screen which has the list of the song is displayed. The list is horizontal as well as vertical scrollable at some parts. When you click on any of the List item or the cards displayed, another screen will appear with an image of the song displayed and the song being played. There is a condition in this like if there is an 'x' song playing and you click on the card of 'y' song then x song will stop and y song will start playing. A slider, song duration, and current position in the song will also be displayed which will be changing each second. Below these, we have a six icon buttons for liking the song, playing next and the previous song, playing and pausing the song and for playing the song in a loop. Out of the six mentioned icon button only two of these which are play and pause work currently. You can change the song duration by sliding through the slider.<br>
In the app bar of each of the screen, we have an Icon button taking you to the profile page and a pop-up menu button which has a Logout and setting feature which is just for display.<br>
The songs keep on playing until you press the pause button or close the app or click on the card or list of another song.<br>
**Note**:-I have added a fix image and song for the whole app and each time you will be hearing the same song and seeing the same image.<br>
